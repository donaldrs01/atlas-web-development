This project is building the HTML skeleton for a website for a mock business called 'Smile School'. 

The index.html file contains the HTML for the site. It includes a header, a main body with different sections for an F.A.Q., testimonials, etc, and a footer with social media links.

In the future, I will integrate. the CSS into this webpage.
