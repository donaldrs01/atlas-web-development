# css_advanced

## Project Overview

The 'css_advanced' project tasked me with re-creating a fairly detailed website provided a draft of the web design. The prior week, I wrote the HTML for the page, and for the past two weeks, I've worked on styling it to match our template. 

The project directory is fairly simple - it contains the HTML file, the CSS file, and a sub-directory containing any relevant images used in the web design.

The primary skills I built up through this project include building responsive designs using flexible layouts, CSS/HTML integration with proper and sensible ID and class tags, and different styling techniques associated with typography and images.
